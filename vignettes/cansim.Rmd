### About

The `cansim` package provides R bindings to [Statistics Canadaâ€™s main socioeconomic time series database](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data), previously known as (and frequently referred to in this package, and elsewhere, as) CANSIM. Data can be accessed by table number, vector or both table number and coordinate. The package accepts both old and new (NDM) CANSIM table catalogue numbers.

### Installing cansim

The `cansim` package is available on CRAN and can be installed directly using the default package installation process:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cansim")
```
Alternatively, the latest development version of the package can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/mountainMath/cansim) using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) or [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) packages.
```{r load_package_cran, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mountainmath/cansim")

library(cansim)
```

### Usage

If you know the data table catalogue number you are interested in, use `get_cansim` to download the entire table.
```{r}
data <- get_cansim("14-10-0293")
head(data)
```
By default, the data tables retrieved by the package comes in the original format provided by Statistics Canada and is enriched by several added columns and transformations.

* An additional `Date` column is added that tries to intelligently infer a Date object from the `REF_DATE` column.
* An additional `val_norm` column is added, that applies the appropriate scaling factor to the `VALUE` column. So if data is coded as "thousands of dollars", a value of `2.4` in the `VALUE` column is converted to a value of `2400` in the `val_norm` column. Similarly, a percentage of `12.2` in the `VALUE` column is converted to a value of `0.122` in the `val_norm` column.
* Categorical variables are converted to factors and, if necessarily, de-duplicated by appending the name of the "parent" category in parenthesis. This ensures that column variables are unique and that they retain their original ordering.

Taking a look at an overview of the data within a table is a common first step. This is implemented in the package with the `get_cansim_table_overview(table_number)` function.
```{r}
get_cansim_table_overview("14-10-0293")
```
When a table number is unknown, you can browse the available tables or search by survey name, keyword or title.
```{r}
search_cansim_cubes("housing price indexes")
```
Individual series in Statistics Canada data tables can also be accessed by using individual numbered vectors. This is especially useful when building reports using specific indicators. For convenience, the `cansim` package allows users to specify named vectors, where the `label` field will be added to the returned data frame containing the specified name for each vector.
```{r}
get_cansim_vector(c("Metro Van Apartment Construction Price Index"="v44176267",
                    "Metro Van CPI"="v41692930"),
                  start_time = "2015-05-01",
                  end_time="2015-08-01") |>
  dplyr::select(Date,GEO,label,VALUE,val_norm)
```
